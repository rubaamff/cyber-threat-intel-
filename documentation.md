# Cyber Threat Intelligence Framework - Detailed Documentation

This document provides comprehensive details about the Cyber Threat Intelligence Framework, covering its architecture, implementation, and usage. It serves as a guide for understanding the various components and their interactions.

## 1. Introduction

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is crucial for proactive cybersecurity. This framework aims to provide a robust and reproducible environment for developing and evaluating machine learning models for threat detection and analysis. The integration of a simulated blockchain for logging predictions enhances transparency and auditability of the model's outputs.

## 2. Project Architecture

The framework is structured into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the CTI pipeline:

*   **Data Preprocessing (`preprocess_data.py`):** Handles the loading, cleaning, and feature engineering of raw network traffic data from diverse sources like NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017. It includes functionalities for merging datasets and selecting relevant features.
*   **IOC Extraction (`extract_iocs.py`):** A placeholder module designed for identifying and extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from various data streams. In a production environment, this would involve sophisticated parsing and pattern matching techniques for IPs, URLs, hashes, and other threat indicators.
*   **Model Training (`train_classifiers.py`):** Contains the core logic for training and evaluating various machine learning models, including supervised (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest), unsupervised (KMeans, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest), and deep learning (LSTM) algorithms. It also supports ensemble modeling for improved performance.
*   **Blockchain Logging (`blockchain_logger.py`):** Implements a simulated blockchain mechanism to log model predictions and their corresponding actual values. This provides an immutable and auditable record of the model's decisions, which is vital for forensic analysis and compliance.
*   **Evaluation Metrics (`evaluation_metrics.py`):** Provides utility functions for generating and saving standard evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices and classification reports. These metrics are essential for assessing the performance and effectiveness of the trained models.
*   **Main Notebook (`main_notebook.ipynb`):** A Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the entire pipeline, demonstrating how to use the individual modules to load data, train models, evaluate performance, and log results. It serves as the primary entry point for reproducing the study's experiments.
*   **Sample Data (`sample_data/`):** Contains subsets of the datasets used in the study, allowing for quick setup and testing of the framework without requiring access to the full datasets. It also includes placeholders for annotated threat data.
*   **Models (`models/`):** A directory for persistently storing trained machine learning models and their associated weights, as well as output artifacts like confusion matrices, classification reports, and feature importance data.

## 3. Data Sources and Preprocessing

### 3.1 NSL-KDD Dataset

The NSL-KDD dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection. It is a refined version of the KDD Cup 99 dataset, addressing some of the inherent problems of the original dataset, such as redundant records. The dataset contains various features extracted from network connections, categorized into normal and attack types.

### 3.2 CICIDS2017 Dataset

The CICIDS2017 dataset is a more recent and comprehensive dataset for intrusion detection, developed by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. It includes a wide range of common attacks, along with benign traffic, and provides detailed network flow features. This dataset is particularly valuable due to its realistic traffic profiles.

### 3.3 Data Merging and Feature Engineering

Our framework merges relevant features from both NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets to create a more robust and generalized training set. This process involves careful mapping of features between the datasets to ensure compatibility. Feature engineering techniques, such as standardization and mutual information-based feature selection, are applied to optimize the dataset for machine learning tasks.

## 4. Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Extraction

The `extract_iocs.py` module is designed to identify and extract IOCs from various data sources. IOCs are forensic artifacts found on a network or operating system that indicate a computer intrusion. Examples include IP addresses, URLs, domain names, file hashes, and registry keys. While the current implementation provides a basic regex-based extraction for demonstration, a production-grade IOC extraction system would leverage advanced techniques such as:

*   **Regular Expressions (Regex):** For pattern-based matching of known IOC formats.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** To identify IOCs embedded within unstructured text, such as threat intelligence reports or security logs.
*   **Threat Intelligence Feeds Integration:** Connecting to external threat intelligence platforms to enrich and validate extracted IOCs.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** Identifying anomalous behaviors that might indicate the presence of unknown IOCs.

## 5. Machine Learning Models for Threat Detection

The framework incorporates a diverse set of machine learning models to address various aspects of cyber threat detection. This multi-model approach enhances the overall detection capabilities and provides flexibility for different types of threats.

### 5.1 Supervised Learning Models

Supervised learning models are trained on labeled data (normal vs. attack) to classify new, unseen network traffic. The framework includes:

*   **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features. It is computationally efficient and often performs well in text classification and spam filtering.
*   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful discriminative classifier that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
*   **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets.

### 5.2 Unsupervised Learning Models

Unsupervised learning models are used for anomaly detection, identifying unusual patterns in data without prior labeling. This is particularly useful for detecting novel or zero-day attacks. The framework includes:

*   **K-Means Clustering:** An algorithm that partitions data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Anomalies can be identified as data points that are far from any cluster centroid or belong to very small clusters.
*   **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** A density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions. It is effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape and handling noise.
*   **Isolation Forest:** An ensemble anomaly detection method based on the concept of isolation. It isolates anomalies instead of profiling normal points. Anomalies are points that are few and different, making them susceptible to isolation.

### 5.3 Deep Learning Model: LSTM

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems. In the context of network traffic, LSTM can learn temporal dependencies and patterns, making it effective for detecting sophisticated, time-series-based attacks. The framework utilizes an LSTM model for its ability to capture complex sequential relationships in network flow data.

### 5.4 Ensemble Modeling

The framework also implements an ensemble model, specifically a Voting Classifier, which combines the predictions of multiple supervised learning models. By aggregating the outputs of individual classifiers, ensemble methods often achieve higher accuracy and robustness than any single model. The Voting Classifier can use either 'hard' voting (majority class) or 'soft' voting (sum of predicted probabilities).

## 6. Blockchain-based Prediction Logging

The `blockchain_logger.py` module simulates a blockchain to provide an immutable and auditable log of model predictions. Each entry in this 


simulated blockchain includes the model name, a timestamp, a unique index, the predicted value, the actual value, and a simple hash of these details. This approach offers several benefits:

*   **Immutability:** Once an entry is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of the prediction logs.
*   **Auditability:** Provides a clear and verifiable trail of all model predictions, which is crucial for compliance, post-incident analysis, and model debugging.
*   **Transparency:** Enhances trust in the AI system by making its decision-making process more transparent and accountable.

While this is a simplified simulation, the concept can be extended to integrate with real blockchain technologies for enhanced security and decentralization of threat intelligence sharing.

## 7. Evaluation Metrics and Reporting

The `evaluation_metrics.py` module provides essential tools for assessing the performance of the trained models. Accurate evaluation is critical for understanding a model's strengths and weaknesses and for making informed decisions about its deployment.

### 7.1 Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class, or vice versa. Key metrics derived from a confusion matrix include:

*   **True Positives (TP):** Correctly predicted positive cases.
*   **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly predicted negative cases.
*   **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly predicted positive cases (Type I error).
*   **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly predicted negative cases (Type II error).

### 7.2 Classification Report

A classification report is a text summary of the precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. These metrics are defined as follows:

*   **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. High precision relates to a low false positive rate.
*   **Recall (Sensitivity):** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in actual class. High recall relates to a low false negative rate.
*   **F1-Score:** The weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. It is a good measure to use when you have uneven class distribution.
*   **Support:** The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.

### 7.3 ROC Curve and AUC

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are graphical plots that illustrate the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve from (0,0) to (1,1). AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 represents a classifier no better than random guessing.
